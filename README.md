# 👋 Hello, I'm Kabir Virk!

- 🌱 I'm currently immersed in the world of embedded systems, where I'm mastering PCB design and diving into the exciting field of machine learning, particularly in the context of robotics.

- 🌐 Beyond my primary interests, I'm exploring cybersecurity through CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges and experimenting with game development using Unreal Engine 5. Specifically, I'm working on a simulator for electrical circuits and logic gates within Unreal Engine 5, leveraging my strong C++ knowledge.

- 🤖 Fueled by a deep passion for embedded systems and machine learning, my mission is to tackle complex challenges and create a meaningful impact through Embedded Machine Learning and robotics.

- 🛠️ My toolkit includes:

   - Languages: Python, C++, with a working knowledge of Java
   - Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
   - Technologies: React, MongoDB, Linux, Unreal Engine, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, EAGLE, Node-RED

- 🔌 My background in front-end development, acquired through the Odin Project, now enables me to craft seamless GUIs and APIs for my robotics projects.

- 💼 I aspire to become an embedded systems engineer and am actively shaping my path through continuous learning and hands-on projects.
